BH 078	2002-03-12 00:00:00.0		VISIT	Participant	Participants	ParticipantId	NIH315	Igra M	Human					The purpose of BH 078 was to collect peripheral blood specimens from patients chronically infected with HIV-1 to study the frequency and molecular basis of broad and potent antibody-mediated virus neutralization and the viral mechanisms of antibody avoidance, as well as other aspects of the immunobiology or immunogenetics of HIV-1 infection pertaining to virus containment.

Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded a grant to a group of investigators to implement 
The Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI), as a US Government 
contribution to the Global HIV/AIDS Vaccine Enterprise (GHAVE). CHAVI 
investigators will use state-of-the art technology through carefully designed, focused, and 
coordinated studies to address Enterprise-identified gaps in our knowledge targeted at 
enabling the production of a successful HIV-1 vaccine. In CHAVI 008, CHAVI 
investigators will work on the discovery of new information about the molecular basis of 
broad and potent HIV-1 neutralization in naturally infected individuals."	BH	Observational	49.261226, -123.113927; 43.653226, -79.383184; 47.560541, -52.712831	Nick Arnold	nicka@labkey.com	Alan Vezina	alanv@labkey.com		"Primary Objectives:
<ul>
<li>To determine the prevalence of acute HIV infection at the participating sites.</li>
<li>To determine the characteristics of the transmitted virus in acute HIV-1 infection.</li>
<li>To determine the host acquired and innate immunes responses that contribute to virus control and/or protection against infection with HIV-1.</li>
<li>To determine the genetic factors that contributes to early virus control and/or protection from infection with HIV-1.</li>
<li>To examine the clinical, laboratory, and behavioral characteristics of individuals at diverse sites with acute HIV infection and their sexual partners, and appropriate controls.</li>
</ul>"	Ongoing	"Up to approximately 1300 participants who are 18 years or older will be enrolled into this study. Eligible participants will be placed into one of the following four study groups:
<ul>
<li>Group 1: Proven acute HIV-1 infection: approximately 600 total</li>
<li>Group 1A: Sexual partners of members of Group 1: approximately 600 total</li>
<li>Group 2: Established HIV-1 infection: approximately 50 total</li>
<li>Group 3: HIV-1 negative: approximately 50 total</li>
