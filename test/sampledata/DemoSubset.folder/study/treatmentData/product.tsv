2	Plasmid IL-2/Ig	Adjuvant	Protein	HIV-1	DNA			PENNVAX™‐B is a mixture of 3 expression plasmids. The plasmids include the genes which encode the HIV‐1 clade B protein Env (pEY2E1‐B), Gag (gag02CAM), and Pol (pPK2C1). These plasmids are each manufactured to a concentration of 4 mg/mL and are formulated with bupivacaine (0.25%) as a facilitating agent for DNA uptake.

3	AIDSVAX B/E (gp120)	Immunogen	Protein	HIV-1	DNA	N/A	Canarypox	AIDSVAX is an experimental HIV vaccine that was developed originally at Genentech in San Francisco, California, and later tested by the VaxGen company, a Genentech offshoot.[1] The development and trials of the vaccine received significant coverage in the international media, but American trials proved inconclusive. The vaccine was then tested on a group of at-risk individuals in Thailand.

6	VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP	Immunogen	Vaccine	HIV-1	DNA		DNA plasmid	VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP is composed of 4 closed, circular DNA plasmids. One plasmid is designed to express clade B HIV-1 Gag/Pol/Nef polyprotein. The other 3 plasmids are designed to express HIV-1 Env glycoprotein from clade A, clade B, and clade C. The plasmid and host E. coli strain used in the production of the vaccine are characterized in accordance with the relevant sections of the FDA guidances.	Vaccine Research Center/NIAID/NIH, Bethesda, MD	Nick Arnold	Molecular Medicine, San Diego, CA	VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP is manufactured by Vical Incorporated (San Diego, CA). The product is formulated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. The vaccine is provided as a 4 mg/mL solution in 2 mL single use glass vials containing 1.2 or 1.3 mL of a clear, colorless, sterile, isotonic solution.	Two toxicity studies were conducted with the adenoviral vector vaccine: 1) 2 doses of Ad5 administered by needle and syringe and 2) 4 doses of DNA vaccine (VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP) administered by Biojector followed by 2 doses of Ad5 administered by needle and syringe.	"The 4-plasmid multiclade HIV-1 DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP has been used in the following studies:
* VRC 004: Phase I
* HVTN 052: Phase IB
* RV 156 (USMHRP): Phase I"	12326	Division of AIDS (DAIDS), NIAID, NIH, Departments of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Bethesda, MD
7	VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP	Immunogen	Vaccine	HIV-1	DNA	Unknown	DNA plasmid	VRC-HIVDNA-016-00-VP is composed of six DNA plasmids in equal concentrations that encode Gag, Pol, and Nef from clade B (strains HXB2, NL4-3, NY5/BRU) and the HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clade A (strain 92rw020), clade B (strains HXB2/BaL), and clade C (strain 97ZA012).	Vaccine Research Center/NIAID/NIH, Bethesda, MD		Vical, San Diego, CA	VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP is manufactured by Vical Incorporated (San Diego, CA). The product is formulated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. The vaccine is provided as a 4 mg/mL solution in 2 mL single use glass vials containing 1.2 mL of a clear, colorless, sterile, isotonic solution. The product must be stored frozen (at -20 C or colder). Vials should not be refrozen after thawing.			11750	National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  Division of AIDS (DAIDS)  Bethesda, Maryland
8	VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP	Immunogen	Vaccine	HIV-1	Viral vector	A10	Adenoviral vector	"The recombinant adenoviral vector product VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (Ad5) is a replication deficient, combination vaccine containing a mixture of 4 recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vectors, each expressing 1 of the 4 HIV antigens gp140(A), gp140(B)dv12, gp140(C) and GagPol(B) driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter. 
The GV11 adenoviral backbone was chosen to reduce the risk of replication-competent adenovirus (RCA) generation during clinical production. The GV11 backbone contains deletions of 2 essential regions, E1 and E4, as well as a partial E3 deletion that render the vaccine product replication deficient. The generation of RCA would require 2 independent recombination events in a single adenovirus genome, predicted to be an extremely rare event. The AdGV (HIV).11D vectors contain HIV-1 antigen open reading frame (ORF) expression cassettes inserted to replace the deleted adenovirus E1 gene region. The other deleted adenovirus regions have been replaced with a transcriptionally inert spacer element (T1S1) that enhances production of the adenoviral vectors.
The 293-ORF6 cell line used to propagate these E1, E4 and partial E3 deleted vectors was developed at GenVec, Inc. These cells were constructed by stably transforming 293 cells (which are of human embryonic kidney origin) with an inducible E4-ORF6 expression cassette. This enables the cells to efficiently complement the E1-, E4-, and partial E3-deleted adenoviral vectors, provide increased transgene capacity and greatly reduce the potential to generate replication-competent adenovirus. The multiclade adenoviral vector vaccine product, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, will be a 3:1:1:1 ratio of the adenoviral vectors that encode for HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively."	Vical, San Diego, CA	Dave McColgin	Molecular Medicine, San Diego, CA	VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP is manufactured by GenVec Incorporated (Gaithersburg, MD) at a contract maufacturer, Molecular Medicine (San Diego, CA). The vaccine is supplied as a 1x1010 PU/mL solution in a 3 mL sterile glass vial containing 1.2 mls of a clear, colorless, sterile, isotonic solution. Although the vial label notes a storage temperature of -10� to -25� C, the product may be stored at temperatures as low as -30� C.	"Biodistribution and toxicity studies with the, single dose, adenoviral vector vaccine (VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP) were conducted in New Zealand White rabbits.
