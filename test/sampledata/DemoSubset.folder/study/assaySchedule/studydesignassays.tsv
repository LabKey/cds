ADCC-Ferrari	Fake ADCC data	This is an ADCC assay.	false	Cellular	Flow cytometry	Immunogenicity	Activation	marki@labkey.com	alanv@labkey.com	The antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a mechanism of cell-mediated immune defense whereby an effector cell of the immune system actively lyses a target cell, whose membrane-surface antigens have been bound by specific antibodies. It is one of the mechanisms through which antibodies, as part of the humoral immune response, can act to limit and contain infection. Classical ADCC is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells; macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils can also mediate ADCC. For example, eosinophils can kill certain parasitic worms known as helminths through ADCC. ADCC is part of the adaptive immune response due to its dependence on a prior antibody response.

Luminex-Sample-LabKey	Fake Luminex data	We measured something using a Luminex assay	false	Humoral	Luminex	Epidemiology	Activation	nicka@labkey.com	nicka@labkey.com	Circulating cytokine levels can provide valuable information about immune status, but often require high-sensitivity assays. Multiplex assays hold great promise, especially when limited sample volumes are available. Four high-sensitivity cytokine multiplex assays (BioRad, BioSource/Invitrogen, Linco/Millipore, Meso Scale Discovery [MSD]) were evaluated for ability to detect circulating levels of cytokines, and for lot and laboratory variability.	cytokine, multiplex, sensitivity	T-cell	CD8	Anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies are a major cause of allograft loss. Solid-phase immunoassays, notably Luminex technology, have lately begun to replace traditional techniques for detecting these antibodies.	An Example Luminex Assay	Rauch	adam@labkey.com
NAb-Sample-LabKey	Fake NAb data	This tested antibodies.	false	Antibody	NAb tool	Immunogenicity	Neutralization	klum@labkey.com	kristinf@labkey.com	The TZM-bl assay measures antibody-mediated neutralization of HIV-1 as a function of reductions in HIV-1 Tat-regulated firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter gene expression after a single round of infection with Env-pseudotyped viruses. This assay has become the main endpoint neutralization assay used for the assessment of pre-clinical and clinical trial samples by a growing number of laboratories worldwide. Here we present the results of the formal optimization and validation of the TZM-bl assay, performed in compliance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) guidelines. The assay was evaluated for specificity, accuracy, precision, limits of detection and quantitation, linearity, range and robustness. The validated manual TZM-bl assay was also adapted, optimized and qualified to an automated 384-well format.	TZM-bl, well, firefly	TZM-bl			A Neutralizing Antibody Assay	Piehler	brittp@labkey.com

This assay reliably detects specific mRNA transcripts at the level of 20-30 copies per cell. Comparison with parallel Northern blotting experiments showed this in situ assay to be much faster and easier to perform and at least 20-fold more sensitive.	microplates, cell, blotting	IgA	IgA2	Immunoglobulin A (IgA, also referred to as sIgA) is an antibody that plays a critical role in mucosal immunity.
