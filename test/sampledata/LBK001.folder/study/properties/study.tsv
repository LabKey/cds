<li>Recruitment of individuals with acute HIV infection. Under this objective, the usefulness of collecting information on locations of sex partner formation in developing countries with generalized epidemics for identifying locations as recruitment sites for CHAVI 001 will be explored.</li>
<li>Notification and recruitment of partners of individuals with acute HIV infection. Under this objective, the following will be explored: Acceptability and feasibility of sex partner notification, including ethical issues, barriers, facilitators, and different methods of notification (patient referral and provider referral), from both the perspectives of the index case and sexual partners, Perceived feasibility of social partner referral (i.e. social contacts)</li>
