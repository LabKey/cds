HIV-1 RT-PCR	HIV-1 RT-PCR	We used this one to look at viruses.	false	Humoral	ICS	Cell Engineering	Activation	Bellew M	Igra M	The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a biochemical technology in molecular biology used to amplify a single or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence.

Luminex-Sample-LabKey	Fake Luminex data	We measured something using a Luminex assay	false	Humoral	Luminex	Epidemiology	Activation	Arnold N	Arnold N	Circulating cytokine levels can provide valuable information about immune status, but often require high-sensitivity assays. Multiplex assays hold great promise, especially when limited sample volumes are available. Four high-sensitivity cytokine multiplex assays (BioRad, BioSource/Invitrogen, Linco/Millipore, Meso Scale Discovery [MSD]) were evaluated for ability to detect circulating levels of cytokines, and for lot and laboratory variability.	cytokine, multiplex, sensitivity			
NAb-Sample-LabKey	Fake NAb data	This tested antibodies.	false	Antibody	NAb	Immunogenicity	Neutralization	Lum K	Fitzsimmons K	The TZM-bl assay measures antibody-mediated neutralization of HIV-1 as a function of reductions in HIV-1 Tat-regulated firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter gene expression after a single round of infection with Env-pseudotyped viruses. This assay has become the main endpoint neutralization assay used for the assessment of pre-clinical and clinical trial samples by a growing number of laboratories worldwide. Here we present the results of the formal optimization and validation of the TZM-bl assay, performed in compliance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) guidelines. The assay was evaluated for specificity, accuracy, precision, limits of detection and quantitation, linearity, range and robustness. The validated manual TZM-bl assay was also adapted, optimized and qualified to an automated 384-well format.	TZM-bl, well, firefly			
mRNA assay	mRNA assay	This one tested gene expression.	false	Humoral	ICS	Cell Engineering	Inhibition	Igra M	Arnold N	A high volume plate-based in situ hybridization assay has been developed, utilizing Amersham Cytostar-Tâ„¢ scintillating microplates. This assay reliably detects specific mRNA transcripts at the level of 20-30 copies per cell. Comparison with parallel Northern blotting experiments showed this in situ assay to be much faster and easier to perform and at least 20-fold more sensitive.	microplates, cell, blotting			
ADCC-Ferrari	Fake ADCC data	This is an ADCC assay.	false	Cellular	ICS	Immunogenicity	Activation	Igra M	Vezina A	The antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a mechanism of cell-mediated immune defense whereby an effector cell of the immune system actively lyses a target cell, whose membrane-surface antigens have been bound by specific antibodies. It is one of the mechanisms through which antibodies, as part of the humoral immune response, can act to limit and contain infection. Classical ADCC is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells; macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils can also mediate ADCC. For example, eosinophils can kill certain parasitic worms known as helminths through ADCC. ADCC is part of the adaptive immune response due to its dependence on a prior antibody response.
