15	Plasmid IL-2/Ig	Adjuvant	Protein	VGX Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Blue Bell, PA	HIV-1	DNA			PENNVAX™‐B is a mixture of 3 expression plasmids. The plasmids include the genes which encode the HIV‐1 clade B protein Env (pEY2E1‐B), Gag (gag02CAM), and Pol (pPK2C1). These plasmids are each manufactured to a concentration of 4 mg/mL and are formulated with bupivacaine (0.25%) as a facilitating agent for DNA uptake.

16	AIDSVAX B/E (gp120)	Immunogen	Protein	VaxGen, Inc., San Francisco, CA	HIV-1	DNA	N/A	Canarypox	AIDSVAX is an experimental HIV vaccine that was developed originally at Genentech in San Francisco, California, and later tested by the VaxGen company, a Genentech offshoot.[1] The development and trials of the vaccine received significant coverage in the international media, but American trials proved inconclusive. The vaccine was then tested on a group of at-risk individuals in Thailand.		Celltrion, Incheon city, Republic of Korea				98-06-12-01	VaxGen, Inc (San Francisco, United States)
