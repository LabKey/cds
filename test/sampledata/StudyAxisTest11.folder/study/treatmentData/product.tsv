4	AIDSVAX B/E (gp120)	Immunogen	Protein	AIDSVAX is an experimental HIV vaccine that was developed originally at Genentech in San Francisco, California, and later tested by the VaxGen company, a Genentech offshoot.[1] The development and trials of the vaccine received significant coverage in the international media, but American trials proved inconclusive. The vaccine was then tested on a group of at-risk individuals in Thailand.			VaxGen, Inc., San Francisco, CA	Celltrion, Incheon city, Republic of Korea		In 1991, AIDSVAX originally consisted of the B envelope of recombinant gp120, a glycoprotein unique to HIV's surface, from a strain of the virus, MN, known at the time to infect people in the United States and Europe.

7	VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP	Immunogen	Vaccine	VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP is composed of 4 closed, circular DNA plasmids. One plasmid is designed to express clade B HIV-1 Gag/Pol/Nef polyprotein. The other 3 plasmids are designed to express HIV-1 Env glycoprotein from clade A, clade B, and clade C. The plasmid and host E. coli strain used in the production of the vaccine are characterized in accordance with the relevant sections of the FDA guidances.

8	VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP	Immunogen	Vaccine	"The recombinant adenoviral vector product VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (Ad5) is a replication deficient, combination vaccine containing a mixture of 4 recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vectors, each expressing 1 of the 4 HIV antigens gp140(A), gp140(B)dv12, gp140(C) and GagPol(B) driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter. 
The GV11 adenoviral backbone was chosen to reduce the risk of replication-competent adenovirus (RCA) generation during clinical production. The GV11 backbone contains deletions of 2 essential regions, E1 and E4, as well as a partial E3 deletion that render the vaccine product replication deficient. The generation of RCA would require 2 independent recombination events in a single adenovirus genome, predicted to be an extremely rare event. The AdGV (HIV).11D vectors contain HIV-1 antigen open reading frame (ORF) expression cassettes inserted to replace the deleted adenovirus E1 gene region. The other deleted adenovirus regions have been replaced with a transcriptionally inert spacer element (T1S1) that enhances production of the adenoviral vectors.
The 293-ORF6 cell line used to propagate these E1, E4 and partial E3 deleted vectors was developed at GenVec, Inc. These cells were constructed by stably transforming 293 cells (which are of human embryonic kidney origin) with an inducible E4-ORF6 expression cassette. This enables the cells to efficiently complement the E1-, E4-, and partial E3-deleted adenoviral vectors, provide increased transgene capacity and greatly reduce the potential to generate replication-competent adenovirus. The multiclade adenoviral vector vaccine product, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, will be a 3:1:1:1 ratio of the adenoviral vectors that encode for HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively."
