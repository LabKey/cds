ADCC-Ferrari	Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl Ester ADCC	This is an ADCC assay.	false	Cellular	Flow cytometry	Immunogenicity	Activation	marki@labkey.com	alanv@labkey.com	The antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a mechanism of cell-mediated immune defense whereby an effector cell of the immune system actively lyses a target cell, whose membrane-surface antigens have been bound by specific antibodies. It is one of the mechanisms through which antibodies, as part of the humoral immune response, can act to limit and contain infection. Classical ADCC is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells; macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils can also mediate ADCC. For example, eosinophils can kill certain parasitic worms known as helminths through ADCC. ADCC is part of the adaptive immune response due to its dependence on a prior antibody response.

14-valent pneumococcal antibody	14-valent pneumococcal antibody	The concentrations of cytokines in human serum and plasma can provide valuable information about in vivo immune status, but low concentrations often require high-sensitivity assays to permit detection. The recent development of multiplex assays, which can measure multiple cytokines in one small sample, holds great promise, especially for studies in which limited volumes of stored serum or plasma are available. Four high-sensitivity cytokine multiplex assays on a Luminex (Bio-Rad, BioSource, Linco) or electrochemiluminescence (Meso Scale Discovery) platform were evaluated for their ability to detect circulating concentrations of 13 cytokines, as well as for laboratory and lot variability.	false	Humoral	Luminex		Activation	jeckels@labkey.com	gktaylor@labkey.com	Labs A to D used fluorescent bead-based instruments (Luminex-100 [Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX] or Bio-Plex 200 [Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA]) and tested three different high-sensitivity kits: Bio-Plex Precision Pro human cytokine 10-plex (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), Human UltraSensitive Cytokine Ten-Plex (BioSource/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and LincoPlex/Milliplex Map high-sensitivity human cytokine panel (13-plex; Linco/Millipore, Billerica, MA) (Table 1). Luminex/Bio-Plex instruments were validated using a Bio-Plex validation kit within 2 weeks of each assay and calibrated on assay days using a Bio-Plex or Luminex validation kit. Labs E and F used electrochemiluminescence instruments (Sector Imager 2400; Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD) and the Th1/Th2 10-plex MSD assay kit; lab E also used a singleplex MSD assay to measure interleukin-6 (IL-6) since this was considered an analyte of particular interest (Table 1). Each assay was performed strictly according to the manufacturer's protocol for serum or plasma samples, utilizing recommended sample dilutions and standard curve concentrations, with all samples and standards assayed in duplicate.

ics_cd4	Intracellular Cytokine Staining: antigen-stimulated CD4+	"Cytokines are soluble proteins that play an important role in immunity, 
inflammation, and hematopoiesis. They are produced by a variety of cell types 
and secreted in response to specific and non-specific stimuli. Cytokines are 
known to regulate cell growth and differentiation and mediate normal and 
pathological immune responses. Monitoring cytokine profiles of T lymphocytes in response to physiological and non-physiological immunomodulators is important for researchers investigating basic immunological function and disease pathogenesis.

Neutralizing Antibody - 3-site validated TZM-bl	Neutralizing Antibody - 3-site validated TZM-bl	Neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are used to study the immune response in infected individuals, to examine monoclonal antibodies and viral diversity, and to judge the potential value of candidate vaccine immunogens in preclinical and clinical trials. An important aspect of these efforts is an ability to achieve and document equivalent assay performance across multiple laboratories. Recent advances in assay technology have led to major improvements in how HIV NAbs are measured. Stable cell lines containing HIV Tat-regulated reporter genes are now available that permit rapid, sensitive and reproducible measurements of virus neutralization after a single round of infection in a high throughput format.Moreover, these assays may be used with molecularly cloned Env-pseudotyped viruses for greater reagent stability and traceability.A luciferase (Luc) reporter gene assay performed in TZM-bl (JC53bl-13) cells was recently optimized and many of its performance parameters have been validated. This assay has become the main endpoint neutralization assay used by the NIH-sponsored HIV Vaccine Trials Network and by a growing number of laboratories worldwide.	false	Antibody	NAb		Neutralization	matthewb@labkey.com	nicka@labkey.com	"The assay is a luciferase (Luc) reporter gene assay that measures HIV neutralization as a function of Tat-regulated Luc reporter gene expression reduction after a single round of HIV infection in TZM-b1 cells(1) (2) . TZM-b1 cells (also called JC53BL-13 cells) are a CXCR4-positive HeLa cell line that expresses the cellular receptor, CD4, and the coreceptor molecule, CCR5(3) . The cell line also contains integrated reporter genes for luciferase and E. coli beta-galactosidase, both under the control of an HIV long-terminal repeat sequence (tat gene)(4) . The cells are susceptible to infection by a variety of HIV, SIV and SHIV strains, including primary HIV isolates and molecularly cloned Env-pseudotype viruses. The assay is a neutralization assay for single-cycle infection with either uncloned viruses grown in human lymphocytes or molecularly cloned Env-pseudotyped viruses produced by transfection in 293T/17 cells. "
